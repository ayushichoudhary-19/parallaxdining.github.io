# Parallax Dining - A Restaurant Website
This is a web development project made in the second year of my college. It us completely responsive (works on mobile and desktop screens). Though the original project was dynamic, I have commented out the php and mysql part in the code because GitHub supports only static websites.

# Demo 
Have a look: https://ayushichoudhary-19.github.io/parallaxdining.github.io/

# Objective
The purpose of this project/ website is to provide a restaurant a platform to let their business grow
online and to build a professional image. It also helps the customers to get a clear idea of the
overall atmosphere of the restaurant, before even stepping a foot inside, by navigating through
different pages. The web pages provide simple,well-defined navigation with a clear user experience
and quality product visuals and descriptions. The project includes 6 web pages that look and work
faultlessly on every phone, tablet, desktop, and internet browser.


# Scope of improvement 
Note: The Order Online page needs updation. As of now, it looks well only on a desktop screen.
