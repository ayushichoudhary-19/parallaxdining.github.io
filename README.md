# Parallax Dining - A Restaurant Website
This is a web development project made in the second year of my college. It us completely responsive (works on mobile and desktop screens). Though the original project was dynamic, I have commented out the php and mysql part in the code because GitHub supports only static websites.
Have a look: https://ayushichoudhary-19.github.io/parallaxdining.github.io/

Note: The Order Online page needs updation. As of now, it looks well only on a desktop screen.
