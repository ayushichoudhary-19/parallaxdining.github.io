# 🍔 Parallax Dining - A Restaurant Website
Welcome to Parallax Dining, where web development meets culinary delight! This project was crafted during my second year of graduation.
It's completely responsive, ensuring it looks fantastic on both mobile and desktop screens.

# 🎯 Objective 
The purpose of this project/website is to provide a restaurant a platform to let their business grow online and to build a professional image. It also helps the customers to get a clear idea of the overall atmosphere of the restaurant, before even stepping a foot inside, by navigating through different pages. The web pages provide simple, well-defined navigation with a clear user experience and quality product visuals and descriptions. The project includes 6 web pages that look and work faultlessly on every phone, tablet, desktop, and internet browser.

# 🛠️ Scope of improvement 
Note: The Order Online page needs updation. As of now, it looks well only on a desktop screen.
